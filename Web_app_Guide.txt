Use PNPM commands to install all the required dependencies and libraries:

1. Core Security Features for Registration
a. Secure Password Management
Use bcrypt or Argon2 for hashing passwords.
Libraries:
bcrypt (more common, widely supported).
argon2 (more secure and future-proof).
b. Input Validation
Ensure all user inputs (e.g., email, passwords, names) are validated on both the client and server side to prevent injection attacks.
Libraries:
Frontend: yup (schema validation).
Backend: express-validator or joi.
c. Email Verification
Require users to verify their email address before activating their account.
Use a JWT token for the confirmation link, which expires after a set time (e.g., 24 hours).
Example flow:
Generate a unique JWT for the user with a short expiration.
Send the email with the confirmation link (e.g., /verify-email?token=xyz).
On link click, verify the token and activate the account.
d. Rate Limiting & CAPTCHA
Protect your registration form against bot attacks:
Rate Limiting:
Backend: Use express-rate-limit to limit the number of requests.
CAPTCHA:
Add a CAPTCHA for added bot protection.
Libraries: react-google-recaptcha or hCaptcha.
e. CSRF Protection
Add CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery.
Library: csurf for Express.
f. Secure Session Management
Use httpOnly cookies for storing session tokens securely.
Implement Secure, SameSite, and Expiration flags for cookies.
g. Logging and Monitoring
Use tools like Sentry or Winston to monitor failed registration attempts and suspicious activity.

2. Recommended Libraries
Frontend Libraries
Formik: For building forms with validation.
Yup: Schema-based validation for registration fields.
React Toastify: For notifications (e.g., "Registration successful").
react-google-recaptcha: For CAPTCHA integration.
Backend Libraries
bcrypt or argon2: For secure password hashing.
jsonwebtoken: For email confirmation links and user sessions.
express-rate-limit: To prevent abuse of the registration endpoint.
csurf: For CSRF protection.
validator: To sanitize and validate user input (e.g., email format).
nodemailer: To send verification emails.

3. Registration Workflow
Frontend Validation:
Validate input fields (e.g., email, password) using yup or a similar library.
Ensure the password meets complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
Prevent submission until all validations pass.
Backend Validation:
Re-validate the input server-side using joi or express-validator.
Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
Hash Password:
Hash the password using bcrypt or argon2 before saving it in the database.
Generate Email Verification Link:
Create a JWT token with the userâ€™s email and a short expiration time.
Send the token in the email confirmation link.
Activate User Account:
When the user clicks the verification link:
Verify the JWT token.
Activate the account in the database.


4. Example Technology Stack
Frontend
React for UI.
Formik + Yup for form handling and validation.
react-google-recaptcha for CAPTCHA.
Backend
Node.js + Express.
bcrypt for password hashing.
jsonwebtoken for email verification.
express-rate-limit for rate limiting.
nodemailer for sending emails.

5. Security Best Practices
Encrypt Sensitive Data: Always hash passwords and avoid storing raw passwords.
Use HTTPS: Encrypt all communications.
Limit Failed Attempts: Lock accounts temporarily after multiple failed registration attempts.
Password Policies: Enforce strong password requirements.
Environment Variables: Store sensitive configurations (e.g., email credentials, JWT secret) in environment variables using tools like dotenv.


Common Issues and Solutions
1. File Path Resolution
Problem: Module import paths causing ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors Solution:
Always use relative paths correctly (./ or ../)
Ensure file names match exactly in imports
Keep consistent naming conventions
2. CORS Configuration
Problem: Cross-origin request blocking Solution:
Code
CopyInsert
const corsOptions = {
    origin: 'https://frontdeskcontrol.com',
    credentials: true,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
};
3. Deployment Issues
Problem: PM2 configuration and process management Solution:
Use proper PM2 configuration file (pm2.config.cjs)
Ensure correct file paths in PM2 config
Regular process monitoring and logging
4. Git Workflow Issues
Problem: Merge conflicts and file structure inconsistencies Solution:
Regular commits and pulls
Resolve conflicts promptly
Maintain consistent file structure between environments
Best Practices for Future Development
File Structure
Keep consistent naming conventions
Use clear directory structure
Document file purposes and dependencies
Code Organization
Separate concerns (routes, middleware, controllers)
Use meaningful variable and function names
Comment complex logic
Deployment Process
Test locally before deployment
Use staging environment when possible
Maintain backup of critical configurations
Version Control
Regular commits with clear messages
Feature branches for new development
Pull requests for code review
